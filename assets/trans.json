    "Another service of a supplementary insurance is birth insurance. Parents can use this insurance to cover a large part of the hospital and birth costs. There is no separate insurance for birth and the coverage of birth costs is one of the supplementary insurance coverages that individuals can benefit from.

    "Drivers' tickets are a collection of codes that indicate the type of violation. For example, the code for lack of insurance is different from other codes. This code tells you that you need to buy insurance as soon as possible. These codes are presented in a complete table with their annual amounts within the traffic laws. In essence, these laws and the payment of traffic fines are very effective in enforcing road safety rules and acting as a deterrent. Each of the traffic violations has a specific amount of fines based on the importance of the violation. In recent years, the fines for each of these codes have increased significantly to prevent traffic violations. In addition, these fines are increasing every year. You may see a higher amount for a particular violation every year when you check your car's violations on the relevant system. 5% has been added to the amount of each of the traffic violations in 1401 compared to 1400 to make people more careful in obeying the rules. For example, illegal passing of special lines, which is one of the most serious violations, has increased by about 5 percent in the year 1401 and has reached 80 thousand IR-Toman. Lack of time is one of the major concerns of living in big cities. So everyone tries to use simpler methods to get things done.

Driving and obeying traffic laws is a basic part of our lives, but there are still some ambiguous areas of the law for some drivers, which causes them to ignore the law and instead face a fine without notice. Therefore, as an informed driver, it is better to be familiar with the latest list of driving violations every year so that no longer a fine will surprise you when you check your vehicle's records.",

This case was considered a loss to the previous owner after the transfer of the lease, and if he tried to recover his insurance discount at this time, the law would not allow him to do so. Another way to explain this is that when the ability to transfer the discount to the buyer is available, the incentive to obey the law is practically gone and a driver with a bad record and a driving record can benefit from the incentive discounts of a law-abiding driver by buying a new car! According to the new law of 1400, if a person transfers his insurance discount to another person other than his family members, he will be a criminal.

    "When it comes to rules of traffic accidents, most people think that the pedestrian is always right and the driver is wrong. However, the main issue is that a car is not a legal entity, but rather the driver and the owner of the vehicle that gives it a legal identity. Under Section 26 of the Traffic Violations Act, if the driver follows the following rules, the pedestrian is considered to be wrong:--If the driver had valid drivers license and driven at the legal speed. The driver followed the rules of urban driving including respecting traffic lights. The driver's vehicle was free of technical and safety defects. The driver made all his best efforts to prevent the accident, but the pedestrian was appearing in front of the vehicle, for example in a highway or when the main traffic signal was green and the pedestrian signal was red. In a pedestrian accident, the driver is not necessarily liable. The pedestrian or the driver can be completely liable. However, in many cases, the fault will be divided between the driver and pedestrian, based on the percentage determined by traffic experts and judges.",

Article 141 of the traffic code states that in places where there is no pedestrian signal but there is a line, the right of way is for pedestrians who intend to cross the line.",

If a pedestrian is hit by a car within 500 kilometers of him, the pedestrian is liable and the driver is not liable. When a pedestrian is hit by a driver, it is a bit difficult to determine who is the primary responsible. However, if pedestrians are found to be negligent, such as ignoring the pedestrian lines, not using the pedestrian bridge, or ignoring the red light, the pedestrian is found to be the primary responsible.",

If the driver is responsible for the accident, the insurance of the car will pay the pedestrian's damages. If the car is not insured, the pedestrian's damages will be covered by the third party liability insurance fund. In 50/50 accidents, the driver is responsible for paying the full damages.",
    "According to Article 717 of the Islamic Penal Code, negligent driving and rules violations can result in a prison sentence of 2 to 6 months. If the driver flees after the accident, his sentence will be doubled. If the accident causes the death of a pedestrian, the insurance company will pay for the damages.",
    "When a pedestrian is involved in an accident, the law of traffic accidents establishes certain limits that can be used to determine the degree of fault of the driver and pedestrian. If the pedestrian is liable for the accident, the amount of the pedestrian's damages will be determined based on the percentage of the driver's fault and will be collected from him or his insurance company. If the vehicle is damaged, the pedestrian will also be liable to pay the driver's damages in the amount of his fault. However, when all responsibility lies on the pedestrian, the insurance of the vehicle is still liable to pay the damages to the pedestrian or his legal heirs based on its obligations. But if all the fault lies on the pedestrian and the vehicle does not have a valid and dated third party insurance, what is the case? What are the rules of pedestrian accidents? In this case, the damages of pedestrians will still be paid from the fund provided for in the law of the compulsory insurance of the owners of motor vehicles against third parties approved on 23 December 1947.",

    "Accident insurance is a type of insurance that covers the risk of a person's death, disability, or infirmity. It is a relatively low-cost insurance option that is designed to protect people from the risks of their jobs. The premium for this insurance is determined by the risk level of each job and the amount of capital coverage. In the Accident Insurance, occupations are classified into 5 categories, each category having its own risk factor. The following table shows the risk levels for each job category and the corresponding coefficient. In the above table, the first column is for jobs with the least risk, such as office and administrative jobs; and the last column is for jobs with the highest risk, such as working in a mine. The annual premium for this insurance is calculated based on the amount of the insurance coverage and the risk factor for each occupational class. For example, if a person in the third occupational class (with a risk factor of 2/2) applied for an accident insurance with a coverage of 50 million IR-Toman, the premium will be calculated as follows: 10000 = 1000/ (500000*2/2) Risk of death, disability and infirmity 75 thousand = 100/ (5,000,000 * 5/1) medical costs",
    "Understand that life insurance is a long-term investment. You can withdraw your policy at any time. The insured can terminate the policy after a certain period (which depends on the insurance company's rules). In this case, the insured will receive the equivalent of the value of the repurchase policy. When you buy back your life insurance, the value of the policy is equal to the total premiums paid plus interest. However, if you buy back your life insurance before the 5th year, the value of the policy is less than the total amount paid. In the first 5 years, the insurance company will take out the issuing, examination, commissions, administrative costs, etc. of the savings of these 5 years. Therefore, if you buy back your life insurance under the 5th year, you will get a lower value than the total amount paid. If you want to buy back your life insurance, it is best to buy back after at least 5 years. According to the tables provided by each insurance company, the amount of the premium is calculated based on the amount of time since the beginning of the policy. For example, the calculation of Asia Life Insurance may differ from Parsian Life Insurance. Depending on the policy, the insured may receive the premium in one lump sum or in certain circumstances as a monthly payment. The acquisition and investment value will be equal to 90 percent, 92 percent, 94 percent, 96 percent, 98 percent of the investment amount in the first to fifth years, and 100 percent of the investment amount in the sixth and following years, after deducting the unclaimed costs. Visit an insurance agent. Provide the original insurance policy. Fill out the form for the withdrawal of the insurance.

In view of this trend, the Central Insurance Authority announced that the renewals of third-party insurance in the beginning of the new year should be done as usual and the difference between the amounts covered by the insurance should be covered by the addition. Therefore, those who have renewed or purchased insurance in the early days of the new year 1401 should apply for the addition.",

    "If you are involved in an accident, you should always take a look at your insurance policy. If you are not responsible for the accident, you should always use the insurance of the responsible driver. If the insurance of the responsible driver covers less than the damages to the injured driver's car, there are two situations. First, the damage to the damaged vehicle exceeds the financial limit of the third party insurance of the responsible vehicle and the damaged vehicle has a body insurance. If the insurance of the responsible driver covers less than the damages to the injured driver's car, the insurance company will write to the injured driver that they have used the recovery coverage, which will not only reduce the insured amount but also affect the discount on the insurance policy. Second case: The damage to the damaged vehicle exceeds the financial coverage of the responsible vehicle's insurance and the damaged vehicle does not have body insurance. In such a case, the parties must go to the arbitration board to reach a final decision on the difference in the amount of damages. If you are involved in an accident, you should always use your car insurance to pay for damages to your car. If you use your car insurance to pay for damages to your car, all discounts will be lost and the insurance amount will be reduced. However, if the driver is found to be responsible, the insured can request the insurance company to restore the discount and the insurance amount to their original state. According to the new insurance policy of the Central Insurance Company (Article 8 (3) and (4) of the compulsory insurance law), the financial losses resulting from road accidents will be covered by the insurance policy of the third party only up to the corresponding amount of the damages to the most expensive conventional vehicle.",
    "If the insurance company is found to be liable in a crash, the insurance of the responsible driver will pay the damages to the injured persons or third parties. If the responsible driver is injured in the accident and has a car insurance, the insurance will pay the damages to him. If the insurance company is not liable, the insurance will not pay any damages.",
    "If the insurance holder is not the faulty driver and the injured driver is involved in an accident, the faulty driver's insurance will pay for the damages to the injured driver's car. If the faulty driver's insurance covers less than the damages to the injured driver's car, there are two situations. First, the damage to the damaged vehicle exceeds the financial limit of the third party insurance of the responsible vehicle and the damaged vehicle has a body insurance. For a better understanding of this situation, look at the following example: If the damaged vehicle has been involved in a collision and the insurance of the responsible driver only covers 10 million rupees, the damaged vehicle can use the coverage of its body insurance to get the remaining 5 million rupees. The question that arises in this case is whether the discount on the damaged vehicle's insurance will be lost. The answer to this question is no, because in such a situation, the insurance company will write to the injured driver that they have used the recovery coverage, which will not only reduce the insured amount but also affect the discount on the insurance policy. Second case: The damage to the damaged vehicle exceeds the financial coverage of the responsible vehicle's insurance and the damaged vehicle does not have body insurance. In such a case, the parties must go to the arbitration board to reach a final decision on the difference in the amount of damages.",

In this case, the rest of the damage to the damaged car is covered by the body insurance. Example: If a 206 crashes with a Benz valued at 700 million rupees and the 206 driver is liable, then the insurance company will only pay part of the damages and the rest of the damages will be paid by the person who is injured, if the 206 has body insurance.",

    "If a luxurious car is hit by a driver who is negligent, the driver who is negligent must pay damages up to the maximum amount of the personal liability insurance coverage, which is about 320 million IRR in 1430. The philosophy of this law is that the price of a car is not more valuable than the life of a human, so it should not exceed half of the full amount of a man's ransom in the holy months. So, in such a case, if the accident-hit vehicle has body insurance, it can use its body insurance coverage, otherwise the owner of the luxurious vehicle must pay the remaining damage. Here we will discuss how to calculate damage in different situations with simple examples. Example 1 Collision with a standard car When a Mazda 6 collides with a Peugeot 206, the insurance of the responsible driver will pay all the damages, because both cars are in the category of ordinary cars and the damages are less than the minimum financial responsibility of the insurance. If a luxury car costs a billion rupees, and a passenger car costs 10 million rupees, the amount of responsibility of the responsible party for the damage is calculated using this formula: The amount of liability of the responsible party = damage to the unusual vehicle × the current price of the most expensive unusual vehicle to the price of the unusual vehicle damaged If a luxury car costs a billion rupees, and a passenger car costs 10 million rupees, the amount of responsibility of the responsible party for the damage is calculated using this formula: The amount of liability of the responsible party = damage to the unusual vehicle × the current price of the most expensive unusual vehicle to the price of the unusual vehicle damaged If a luxury car costs a billion rupees, and a passenger car costs 10 million rupees, the amount of responsibility of the responsible party for the damage is calculated using this formula: The amount of liability of the responsible party = damage to the unusual vehicle × the current price of the most expensive unusual vehicle to the price of the unusual vehicle damaged If a luxury car costs a billion rupees, and a passenger car costs 10 million rupees, the amount of responsibility of the responsible party for the damage is calculated using this formula: The amount of liability of the responsible party = damage to the unusual vehicle × the current price of the most expensive unusual vehicle to the price of the unusual vehicle damaged If a luxury car costs a billion rupees, and a passenger car costs 10 million rupees, the amount of responsibility of the responsible party for the damage is calculated using this formula: The amount of liability of the responsible party = damage to the unusual vehicle × the current price of the most expensive unusual vehicle to the price of the unusual vehicle damaged If a luxury car costs a billion rupees, and a passenger car costs 10 million rupees, the amount of responsibility of the responsible party for the damage is calculated using this formula: The amount of liability of the responsible party = damage to the unusual vehicle × the current price of the most expensive unusual vehicle to the price of the unusual vehicle damaged If a luxury car costs a billion rupees, and a passenger car costs 10 million rupees, the amount of responsibility of the responsible party for the damage is calculated using this formula: The amount of liability of the responsible party = damage to the unusual vehicle × the current price of the most expensive unusual vehicle to the price of the unusual vehicle damaged If a luxury car costs a billion rupees, and a passenger car costs 10 million rupees, the amount of responsibility of the responsible party for the damage is calculated using this formula: The amount of liability of the responsible party = damage to the unusual vehicle × the current price of the most expensive unusual vehicle to the price of the unusual vehicle damaged If a luxury car costs a billion rupees, and a passenger",
    "Luxury cars are expensive and therefore they need to be insured. However, they also need to be insured against damages that the third party insurance does not cover.

    "The third party insurance is almost the same in all insurance companies that offer it. However, the amount of insurance varies annually based on the amount of the damages for a non-intentional murder of a Muslim. Because the third party insurance guarantees the life insurance amount of the damages. This way, every increase in the amount of compensation will be reflected in the price of insurance. So, a price comparison of insurance shows that the compensation has increased by 21 percent. Remember that all insurances for cars and motorcycles are based on the laws of accidents. It seems reasonable to adjust the third party insurance amount to the amount of the damages to humans. Another important point is that third party insurance covers accidents with pedestrians. However, how and how much this coverage depends on the laws of accidents with pedestrians.

    "In the history of insurance, the first type of insurance that was applied before the 19th century is the insurance of shipping. Other insurance types were gradually introduced after the Industrial Revolution. The Greeks are believed to be the inventors of this type of insurance, which is called insurance of shipping. According to this type of insurance, shippingmen and merchants borrowed money from merchants and traders and if they were able to complete their journey safely, they would have to pay the amount borrowed with interest for a certain period of time. During this period, the merchant's bonds were held by the debt holder and if they were not paid back on time, they could put them up for sale. However, if the ship was faced with maritime accidents or maritime thieves took the goods, the merchant would not have to pay the loan. This type of insurance was common in the Mediterranean countries around 500 to 600 BC. Some sources claim that this type of insurance was common in India and China two thousand years before Christ. However, insurance in its modern sense started in the 14th century. Because in Christianity, taking interest was considered Haram, and investors were not willing to lend their money without interest, and merchants were not able to continue their business without loans. This was the obligation and necessity that led them towards a new method, which was actually a condition along with a loan, which was first practiced in 1947 in the city of Genoa, Italy, among the Romans. To avoid the excuse of the church, the borrower would pay a reward instead of interest, which was actually the same as the previous interest, but the church could not stop it. Insurance, despite this objection, quickly developed and went so far that evidence shows that in the office of insurance in Geneva in 2014, there were 80 insurance contracts signed in a month. In the 15th century, a number of xads focused their business on insurance. In 1552, a group of insurance agents formed a sophisticated organization in Florence. The British merchants and sailors in the early 17th century formed a partnership in a London coffee shop called Lodz, which can be considered the earliest form of modern insurance. In fact, they founded Lodz Insurance Company, which is now one of the largest companies in the insurance industry. The second insurance category is fire insurance, which was established after the devastating London fire in 1667. The first insurance category that came into the United States was fire insurance. After World War II, social insurance developed. In the 1880s, social insurance was introduced in Germany and in 1911, the National Insurance Act was passed in the United Kingdom.",
    "Insurance in Iran has a long history and has changed over time. The first insurance company in Iran was established in 1270 by Lazar Polyakov, a Russian named Lazar Polyakov. During the reign of Ahmad Shah Qajar in 1289, two Russians named Nadzha and Kafkaz Mercouri started insurance activities in Iran. Foreign insurance companies gradually entered the insurance market in Iran and for nearly 25 years, they held the market for insurance in Iran. In 1914, there were 29 foreign insurance companies in Iran, which were active until the beginning of the revolution. In 1914, Alexander Agaian and Ali Akbar Davr established the Islamic Insurance Company of Iran, which was a joint venture between the government and the private sector. This was a turning point in the history of insurance in Iran. Before the establishment of the Islamic Insurance Company of Iran, there was no 100% national company in the Middle East or even in India. In this period of insurance history, foreign insurance companies took on the company and tried to negotiate a self-insurable contract with the company. In 1916, a law was passed by the National Assembly of Iran that allowed the insurance of government agencies to be taken over by the Iran Insurance Company. This was the first insurance company in Iran. All government agencies were required to insure 25% of their insurance in Iran in the Iran Insurance Company. In the government of Dr. Massoud in 1931, a law was passed that restricted the activities of foreign insurance companies in Iran. In 1929, the first private insurance company in Iran was established with the name of East Insurance Company and between 1929 and 1943, eight private insurance companies in Iran were established and their activities were more visible than those of foreign foundations. In 1949, the Higher School of Insurance was established and in 1950, the Central Insurance Act was passed. In the same year, insurance companies such as Tehran Insurance Company, Dana Insurance Company, Hafez Insurance Company and Iran and America Insurance Company were established with foreign investment. So, before the revolution, 13 private insurance companies and 2 foreign representatives were active in the industry. In 1958, all Islamic insurance companies were nationalized by the Revolutionary Council and under Article 44 of the Constitution, all insurance activities were under the control of the government. In the 1960s and 1961s, only three insurance companies were allowed to issue insurance policies: Iran, Asia and Alborz. In 1967, 10 insurance companies merged and formed Dana Insurance Company.",

    "having children and experiencing the feeling of being a father and mother is one of the most important decisions that couples make during their marriage. However, in this path, they may encounter some problems that may make it difficult to get pregnant in the desired time. This can sometimes cause concern and stress in families trying to get pregnant. This stress can lead to a lack of confidence in couples, leading to them believing that they are infertile. Infertility is not the same as infertile.

In addition, all of these factors increase the cost of treatment and without having additional infertility insurance, it is difficult for many couples to pay for the high costs.",

Third party insurance can be purchased from minimum 7 million and 700 thousand rupees to maximum 154 million rupees. Most insurances you buy cover a minimum of 7 million and 700 thousand rupees. If you have a expensive car and the damage exceeds 7 million and 700 thousand rupees, you will have to pay the rest of the damage from your pocket and the insurance company will not be responsible for paying the rest of the damage, which in many cases will put you in a financial crisis. With the increase in the number of expensive cars, this has become a major challenge. According to the new insurance policy, the damage is equivalent to 154 million, which is half the amount of a Muslim man's separation. For example, if a car is 560 million rupees, and it gets 50 million rupees in damages, because the damage limit is 154 million and one-fourth of 560 million rupees, the responsibility of the driver is also one-fourth of 50 million rupees, or 14 million and 750 thousand rupees. But even if you choose the minimum coverage, only 7 million and 700 thousand rupees will be covered by the insurance company and the rest of the damage will be covered by you.

According to the Islamic calendar, the amount of damages in a month of haram is 640 million IRR. One-fourth of this amount is 16 million IRR.

In case of death, the insurance will pay the full amount (480 million IRR in a non-haram month and 640 million IRR in a haram month).",
    "The basic idea of the discount on insurance is that if you are a law-abiding and careful driver and have a year without accidents, you can use the \"no-accident discount\" when you renew your insurance. Before, if someone wanted to sell his car, they had to transfer the discount points of years of clean driving to the next buyer. That is, if someone has not used insurance for 7 years and wants to sell his car, he must transfer all the insurance and the significant discount for non-injury to the new buyer (who may not have the same clean record). But with the new changes, the transfer of discounts from vehicle-based to \"driver-based\" has changed. So, after selling your car, you don't need to worry about your discounts of non-injury insurance because you can transfer them to a new car or to your family members (provided they are 18 years old).",

This damage can be caused by car theft, accident, fire, or accident. Given the breadth of car insurance services, it is logical that people are looking for the best car insurance for their car.

This is why insurance companies recommend that the insured use all the security measures to protect their car.",

    "When you use a discount coupon, you should take into account the price difference in the years following. If you are a discounted third year driver, you will pay a premium of 1,141,200 IR-Toman if you use your discount coupon. If you don't use your discount coupon, you will pay a premium of 798,800 IR-Toman. The difference between the two numbers is 342 thousand IR-Toman. In a typical scenario, you would pay 342 thousand IR-Toman if you use your discount coupon. However, if you are a discounted third year driver, you will pay a premium of 798,800 IR-Toman if you don't use your discount coupon. But in reality, if you use the coupon, you will pay more for insurance not only the year after, but for 7 years after. The chart below shows the blue columns indicating that the coupon was not used and the yellow columns indicating that the coupon was used. So in the given example, when you want to use the insurance policy, you should not only think about the difference of 342 thousand rupees next year, but also think about the difference of the years after that. However, you may not want to keep your car for a few years and the costs of future years are not important to you. Or you may not have the cash to pay for the cost. But always calculate the cost before you use a discount coupon. Also, take into account that the more discount you have, the more you will pay for the voucher. You can see the actual cost (current value) of the voucher based on the number of years of discount you have. These figures are for an example. As you can see, the figures are higher than expected. According to the table, if you get a discount on your accident insurance in the seventh year, it will be worth less than 3023000 IR-Toman to pay in cash.

    "Life insurance is a very important investment for many people in Iran. However, many people do not know the right information about the insurance coverage and investment options. In research conducted by Samia Safaei, a master of social science, individual factors such as marital status, job status, income level, age and awareness of life insurance have been identified as the most influential factors in purchasing life insurance. 32% of people said they were not willing to buy insurance because they were not aware of the terms of the insurance. Life insurance needs to be recognized because most people do not have the right information about the insurance coverage and investment options! For example, if they know that after paying the first monthly payment, they are covered by insurance and even if they die, all the money they choose will be transferred to their heirs. They will receive all the money they have saved slowly and gradually with guaranteed interest and participation interest at the end of the contract. Why should they resist buying life insurance? So the first reason for the lack of interest in life insurance in Iran is the lack of proper information and training.",
    "Poor income growth, living in poverty and lack of income in the lower income classes and high inflation are factors that make people less likely to buy life insurance. So, the lower the income, the less likely it is to buy life insurance. And the higher the inflation, the less likely it is to buy life insurance. Financial problems and shortages make people focus more on the present than the future and one of the most important features of life insurance is the future outlook! After-effects of life insurance investment are long-term and require more patience, while bad economic conditions cause people to seek short-term investments with quick returns. 10% of people said they did not buy life insurance because of the high premiums and 17% said they did not have enough monthly income. So we can conclude that high inflation reduces the purchasing power of people and therefore makes people less likely to buy life insurance.",
    "Why is life insurance necessary? Many people think that they are covered by social security, health care and retirement funds. However, these types of insurance are good, but inflation and financial and economic problems have also affected these organizations. Some people believe that they cannot pay more than they are owed, and with inflation and expenses of individuals during life, the benefits of these organizations cannot sustain the needs of individuals. So, for the welfare of the family, it is necessary to have a supplemental life insurance and savings insurance to benefit from the investment and even the benefits of the insurance.",

Because now the value of the car is double the value at the time of insurance. In such a situation, the insurance company will only pay half of the damage, which is 3.5 million rupees.

    "The fixed amount of money is a fixed amount of money which is fixed in the Holy Quran, for the murder of a person, a body, or a good, or for a murder of a person, a body, or a good, in cases where there is no killing. Under this law, if someone commits a non-intentional crime, such as a traffic accident, they are liable to pay a certain amount of the damages to the victim or their heirs. However, in cases of intentional crimes, such as murder and assault, if there is no killing, the suspect is liable to pay damages. Sometimes, the victim or the heirs of the victim agree to receive damages instead of execution of the sentence of killing. The ransom is equal to 100 goats, 100 cows, 200 sheep, 1000 gold dinars or 10000 silver dinars. However, the ransom varies according to the month of the year, depending on the haram or non-haram month. According to the latest ruling of the judiciary, the full ransom of a human in 1403 is equivalent to 1 billion and 200 million IRR, and this amount increases to 1 billion and 600 million IRR in the haram months.

Because they are called the holy months in Islam, they are called the holy months. The amount of the denial in these months is always higher than the denial in the other months of the year.

    "The mandatory residential insurance which started in January 1400 is actually the same as the fire insurance. This type of insurance has two main and secondary coverages. The main coverage focuses on fire and its causes. The secondary coverage covers damages caused by other causes such as floods, earthquakes, and earthquakes. Additionally, you can benefit from other types of damages to your residential property, including natural and non-natural damages. This type of insurance will be offered for 30 million residential properties and the premiums will be charged on your electricity bill. Initially, the insurance coverage was supposed to be 30 million IR-Toman and the premium was 120 thousand IR-Toman. The government was supposed to pay half of the premium and the other half was collected monthly from the owners. But now, with the increase in prices and the coverage, the premium will increase. compulsory insurance of residential buildings is a positive and forward-looking move, but is it as easy to implement as it looks? In the answer, yes. If mandatory housing insurance is implemented properly and with appropriate support, it can be a useful tool for all people during the implementation. You know that in recent years, various earthquakes, floods and unpredictable natural disasters have occurred in our country. On the other hand, with the increase in the use of gas and electric appliances, the risk of fire in residential buildings is high. Mohammad Esmail Najjar, the Deputy Minister of the Interior and the Head of the Emergency Management Agency, announced the mandatory insurance of residential buildings in February of 2020. In a press conference, Najjar pointed out some interesting points. Points that make the mandatory insurance of residential buildings seem relatively technical and having a bright future. According to Najjar, owners of residential houses should take xa0 with their electricity bills to insurance companies and organizations. Their property is insured based on the real value of the building, along with the furniture and appliances of the house. In fact, any property that is issued a utility bill for is covered by the mandatory residential insurance law. But the question that many people are asking is \"Given the sudden and sharp increase in the prices of housing in the past 2 or 3 years, what if someone does not have enough financial capacity to pay the insurance?\" According to Najjar, the compulsory insurance law allows three groups to be exempted from paying the insurance premium and the government will pay for the insurance premium. These three groups are the beneficiaries of the Imam Khomeini (r) Committee for Social Welfare, the people under the care of the Social Welfare Organization and the needy who are not under the care of the social welfare organizations but who are proved to be poor. compulsory insurance of residential buildings is not a new concept and was introduced in the last months of 1991 but was abandoned. But now the serious implementation of this type of insurance is a new and positive event that can significantly ease the minds of the victims of an accident. We hope you never need to use mandatory residential insurance, whether in the form of secondary or primary coverage. However, you should be aware that Iran is one of the 10 most hazardous countries in the world in terms of natural disasters, so it seems reasonable to insure your significant investment, such as your home, against various unexpected events. In fact, the requirement to buy fire insurance is a significant protection for your investments and life, not a further cost.

In this type of insurance, a certain amount of coverage is established and under no circumstances a higher amount is paid to the insured. For example, if the maximum damage is 70 million rupees and the damage is 100 million rupees, the insurance will not cover more than 30 million rupees. On the other hand, in a 75 million rupee damage, this type of excess can be more affordable than a twenty percent excess.",

In some insurances, the premium is a percentage of the insurance amount and the higher the insurance amount, the higher the premium. In some insurances, the premium is a percentage of the insurance amount and the higher the insurance amount, the higher the premium. Sometimes the allowance is not fixed as a fixed amount, but a certain percentage of the damage is allocated to the allowance, which is usually a small amount. The more the damage is, the more the allowance is, and the more the person who was injured pays. For example, if the premium is 20%, the insurance company will pay 200,000 IRR for a one million rupee damage. If the same insurance company claims that the insurance company will pay 10 million rupees, the insurance company will pay 2 million IRR for the damage. In many types of insurance, the excess is defined in a combination. This means that the excess is calculated by using the maximum amount of damages and the percentage of the excess. For example, the excess of 20% or the insurance amount is deducted from the amount and the choice between these two options depends on which one is lower.",

    "Franchise is a very important part of risk management and is usually present in most insurance policies. It has three-sided benefits, both for the insured, the community, and the insurer. Insureds are usually not concerned about minor damages and small costs, but in other cases, damages can significantly affect the value of the insured's assets. For example, a person may be able to afford a small illness but a serious surgery requires insurance. In such cases, the premiums are more reasonable and reasonable to pay to the injured person. Another reason for the importance of a franchise in car insurance and third party insurance is that the insurance company becomes more economical and lowers the premium. A franchise makes the insured less likely to go to the insurance company for additional costs, which saves the insurance company a lot of money and makes it more economical. Sometimes the need for a prescription is for better social behavior, more care, safer driving, and other issues that contribute to the health of the community. In a supplementary health insurance, a prescription can prevent unnecessary visits to the hospital and avoid wasting energy in the medical and other departments.",

    "When buying a used car, it is important to have a professional automobile inspection. This process involves examining the car body, chassis, and transmission. The inspection of the chassis and pillars is a technical matter, and it is recommended to leave this area to a professional. The inspection of the car body is a crucial step in preventing damage to the car in accidents. It is also important to identify replacement parts, as sometimes parts can be removed from one car and put on another car.
